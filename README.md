lbl-bootstrap
=============

LBL-Bootstrap is a simple front-end development bootstrap for building mobile first responsive websites. It takes the best ideas from some of the most renowned frameworks and bootstraps, combines them and then strips out the bloat.

It pulls only the essentials from Initializr then adds jQuery, LESS support, Normalize and Preboot. It's based on a configurable semantic grid (978px with 30px margins by default) thanks to Preboot and is filled with just enough demo content to be useful. Oh, and it comes with a responsive design debugging tool I built to help test media queries quicker too.

There's a demo up here: http://littlebiglab.com/bootstrap/

LBL-Bootstrap has been tested and renders consistently on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE8+, Mobile Safari for iOS 5/6 and the Android 2.3 / 4.x stock browser.

Much developer love to the folks who make modern web development a pleasure:
